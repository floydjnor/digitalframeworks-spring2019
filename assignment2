A description of the question you're curious about, and an explanation about how this data could turn into a story. (Imagine this as your justification to your editor as to why this is worth your time)
- I'm curious about if opportunity zones offer companies that speacialize in environmental improvement an incentive and reason to invest in communities of color.

A list of the things you want to know about any data point
-I want to know the demographics of opportunity zones in 10 major cities across the country
-How many environmentally hazardous businesses and infrustructure projects are in the opportunity zone
-How many jobs could environment improvement companies stimulate in the opportunity zone
-How what are the salary ranges for such jobs
-How many companies would invest in an opportunity zone and how long would it take to begin the business

An explanation of how you'd go about collecting that data (you don't actually have to do it on an ongoing basis, especially if it involves staking something out, just tell me how you would do it).
-I would use census data, opportunity zone block-by-block maps, interviews with environment improvement companies, company statistics and interview local environment focused advocacy groups

A table including at least five data points in this dataset

Opportunity zone | hazards in the area         | minority population percent | unemployment rate | median household income |povery rate     |
---------------- | ----------------------------| ----------------------------| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | 
Flint, Michagin  | water infrastructure system | 62.6%                       |             48.8% | $26,330                 | 41.2% .        |

You can put your data in a google sheet (in which case, put the link in your homework) or make a table directly in the document you submit.
