Additionally, write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.
  -I deleted unneccessary columns
  -I checked for columns with repeated words or phrases
  -I checked for missing data or blank boxes
  The data was relatively clean and required little tweaking.
Lastly, write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.

Headline:There they are! Wards with affordable housing options.

Nut graf: In a city where families are leaving in droves to escape rising rent, a few Chicago wards offer thousands of affordable housing units. Most of the units citywide are offered in multifamily developments.
